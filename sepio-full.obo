Those natural – as contrasted with engineered, which here means: deliberately executed – units which do exist in the realm of occurrents are typically either parasitic on the existence of natural units on the continuant side, or they are fiat in nature. Thus we can count lives; we can count football games; we can count chemical reactions performed in experiments or in chemical manufacturing. We cannot count the processes taking place, for instance, in an episode of insect mating behavior.Even where natural units are identifiable, for example cycles in a cyclical process such as the beating of a heart or an organism’s sleep/wake cycle, the processes in question form a sequence with no discontinuities (temporal gaps) of the sort that we find for instance where billiard balls or zebrafish or planets are separated by clear spatial gaps. Lives of organisms are process units, but they too unfold in a continuous series from other, prior processes such as fertilization, and they unfold in turn in continuous series of post-life processes such as post-mortem decay.

comment: ICEs are abstract entities that convey information about things in the world. ICEs represent the information encoded in physical artifacts such as photographs, books, or digital storage medium (as opposed to the physical medium itself).  A particular ICE can be encoded simultaneously in many physical or digital mediums and formats. For example, only one instance of the first edition of "War and Peace" exists as an ICE, representing information conveyed in this work. But many instances of "War and Peace" exist at the level of their physical concretizations in printed books or digital devices.

comment: The notion of a proposition, and its relationship to an assertion, derives from the domain of logic and philosophy [12]. Propositions are abstract entities that, like numbers, are independent of space and time. They represent only the meaning that is expressed in a particular agent’s assertion, and are ‘sharable’ in that the same proposition can be expressed in many different assertions. Propositions are primary bearers of truth value, in that they are true or false.  \n\nFrom http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/propositions/: "Propositions are the sharable objects of the attitudes and the primary bearers of truth and falsity. This stipulation rules out certain candidates for propositions, including thought- and utterance-tokens, which presumably are not sharable, and concrete events or facts, which presumably cannot be false."

comment: An evidence line is created through the interpretation of one or more pieces of information that collectively support a meaningful argument for or against a proposition. To qualify as an Evidence Line, this argument must be independently significant as evidence - i.e. it must be capable of affecting the probability of accepting the target proposition as true. This does not mean, however, that it is independently sufficient to establish belief in the proposition, as additional evidence lines may be required to ultimately accept the proposition as true. \nFor example, in the ACMG framework  for variant interpretations establishes "absence in population databases" as a type of evidence line that can argue for the pathogenicty of a particular variant. But this argument alone is not considered sufficient to establish a variant's pathogencity, as the other types of evidence are additionally required to establish the truth of this Proposition (e.g. a line of evidence demonstrating the variant to have a deleterious effect on protein function, or showing it to segregate with disease features in a family tree).

def: "A data item that quantifies the degree of support an agent believes an evidence line to provide for a particular proposition." []
comment: The strength of a line of evidence typically depends on the *type* and *quality* of the study(ies) that generate its supporting evidence items.  \n\n1. Type of Study: In a particular domain of research, certain types of studies are commonly held to produce data that is more meaningful and reliable than others, as evidence for a particular type of assertion.  These more reliable studies tend to draw on experimental systems that more accurately replicate the natural phenomenon being studied, and experimental designs that reduce confounding variables and biases. For example, in vivo studies of gene function provide stronger evidence than in vitro systems that may not replicate all aspects of the biology of a living system, and randomized controlled clinical trials are held to be more reliable than retrospective or case control studies that are more susceptible to confounding factors.  \n\n2. Quality of Study: A given study can be performed to varying degrees of rigor and comprehensiveness,  irrespective of the type of study it represents. This is another important factor in assessing the overall strength of evidence it may produce.  Higher quality studies will have carefully defined controls, and be replicated numerous times to ensure reproducibility.  Other factors that are often used as secondary indicators of the quality of research data include the quality of the journal in which it is published, and the reputation of the lab or institution performing the study. \n\nIn SEPIO, the notion of evidence quality is captured in an attribute separate from the notion of evidence strength. And the notion of study type can be represented in the type assigned to a study instance, or the evidence code used to type an evidence line (which are often based on the type of study that produced the evidence data).  Evidence strength typically relies on assessment of one or both of these more fundamental attributes of evidence.

def: "A statement describing the immediate results of a research study, describing what was directly observed, measured, or derived through mathematical calculation." []
comment: A study finding is a statement that summarizes the immediate results of a particular experiment or study. It describes only what was directly observed, measured, or calculated, and optionally the experimental context of these observations.  It does not describe more general conclusions that may have been inferred from such results. As such, the scope of what a finding describes is limited to the direct participants in the study - i.e. it is about only the instances observed or measured in the study.  It makes no broader inference or conclusion about types or classes to which these instances belong. \n\nThis is not to say that the onserved findings are necessarily accurate or correct - only that they were indeed made in a particular study. For example, the finding that "Sequencing of DNA from patient X revealed an A->T mutation at position 2143 in gene Y" is a matter of fact - this was the outcome of the assay, even if the finding is an artifact of low sequencing coverage. Metadata about the finding (e.g. sequencing methods/reagents used, coverage or read depth) are recoded so users can judge for themselves whether the objectively reported finding accurtely reflects the biology it describes.
comment: SEPIO distinguishes two high-level subtypes of statements:\n1. Findings are statements that report the immediate, objective results of an experiment, observation, or study -  without bias or interpretation.  A finding statement results simply from an act of reporting or summarizing these direct observations, calculations, or measurements.\n2. Assertions, by contrast, result from acts of interpretation and/or inference, based on information used as evidence. The statement here is a conclusion drawn from critical evaluation of this more foundational information, and its validity depends on the quality of this information and its interpretation as evidence.

property_value: IAO:0000116 "In SEPIO, a high-level distinction is made between statements that are 'findings' vs 'assertions'.  Findings are statements that report/summarize what was directly observed or calculated in a study, and are about only the immediate  participants in the experiment or study. As such, findings involve no interpretation or inference from the data to draw broader conclusions. Assertions, by contrast, are statements that derive from some degree of interpretation or inference based on the evaluation of 'evidence', and often make broader claims about the types or categories to which study participants belong. This distinction is important because the provenance and validity of a 'finding' statement does not depend on subjective interpretation of 'evidence' in the same way that of an assertion does. This has modeling implications for how findings and assertions are linked to information that supports them.\n\nIn practices, instances of 'study findings' are used to group one or more data items from a particular research study that are relevant as evidence for an assertion.  The utility of this class is in allowing the shared provenance of these data items to be more efficiently represented - as things like agent, date, and methods can be described once for the data set and inferred to apply to all individual data items that comprise it." xsd:string

Which means that findings are not the direct output of an assay, which merely generates data. So perhaps in SEPIO we commit to only considering research processes at the level of studies - such that even assays would potentially involve some act of summarizing the results as a finding.\n\n- Note that at present 'study data sets' can serve the same 'organizational' purpose as 'study findings' - we should converge on one recommended way to perform this level of organization of evidence data." xsd:string

def: "An information content entity expressing a declarative sentence that is either true or false." []
comment: From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statement_(logic) (2017-06-21):\n"A statement is a declarative sentence that bears truth value, in that it can be either true or false. This definition derives from the domain of logic, where a statement is either (a) a meaningful declarative sentence that is either true or false, or (b) that which a true or false declarative sentence asserts. In the latter case, a statement is distinct from a sentence in that a sentence is only one formulation of a statement, whereas there may be many other formulations expressing the same statement . . . In (this treatment), "statement" is introduced in order to distinguish a sentence from its informational content. A statement is regarded as the information content of an information-bearing sentence. Thus, a sentence is related to the statement it bears like a numeral to the number it refers to. Statements are abstract logical entities, while sentences are grammatical entities."\n----\nNote that the definition in (b) describes something closer to the notion of a 'Proposition' as defined in SEPIO?
comment: Statements are sentences (or, more precisely, the information content of sentences) that declare a definitive or proposed fact - expressing something about the world or one's experience of it that may or may not be true. The identity of a particular Statement is dependent upon (1) what it reports as true (its semantic content), (2) the Agent stating it, and (3) the occasion on which the statement is made. \n\nThe phrase "the pink elephant" describes an entity, but is not a 'statement' as it has no truth value. By contrast, the phrase "the pink elephant is in the room" is a statement as this can be evaluated for its truth.

def: "A statement describing something that was observed or recorded." []
comment: An observation reflects only what an agent observed or device recorded. It is therefore considered a matter of fact, rather than a propositional assertion that may or may not be true.  This does not mean that the observations or recordings were necessarily accurate or correct - only that they were indeed made by an agent.  For example, the observation that "I counted six ducks in the pond" is a matter of fact, even if there are actually seven because I missed one that was hiding in the reeds.

Where derives_from links classes of continuants, preceded_by links classes of processes. Clearly, however, these two relations are not independent of each other. Thus if cells of type C1 derive_from cells of type C, then any cell division involving an instance of C1 in a given lineage is preceded_by cellular processes involving an instance of C.    The assertion P preceded_by P1 tells us something about Ps in general: that is, it tells us something about what happened earlier, given what we know about what happened later. Thus it does not provide information pointing in the opposite direction, concerning instances of P1 in general; that is, that each is such as to be succeeded by some instance of P. Note that an assertion to the effect that P preceded_by P1 is rather weak; it tells us little about the relations between the underlying instances in virtue of which the preceded_by relation obtains. Typically we will be interested in stronger relations, for example in the relation immediately_preceded_by, or in relations which combine preceded_by with a condition to the effect that the corresponding instances of P and P1 share participants, or that their participants are connected by relations of derivation, or (as a first step along the road to a treatment of causality) that the one process in some way affects (for example, initiates or regulates) the other." xsd:string

It is divided into two branches: causal relations between occurrents/processes, and causal relations between material entities. We take an 'activity flow-centric approach', with the former as primary, and define causal relations between material entities in terms of causal relations between occurrents.\n\nTo define causal relations in an activity-flow type network, we make use of 3 primitives:\n\n * Temporal: how do the intervals of the two occurrents relate? \n * Is the causal relation regulatory?\n * Is the influence positive or negative\n\nThe first of these can be formalized in terms of the Allen Interval Algebra. Informally, the 3 bins we care about are 'direct', 'indirect' or overlapping. Note that all causal relations should be classified under a RO temporal relation (see the branch under 'temporally related to'). Note that all causal relations are temporal, but not all temporal relations are causal. Two occurrents can be related in time without being causally connected. We take causal influence to be primitive, elucidated as being such that has the upstream changed, some qualities of the donwstream would necessarily be modified.\n\nFor the second, we consider a relationship to be regulatory if the system in which the activities occur is capable of altering the relationship to achieve some objective. This could include changing the rate of production of a molecule.\n\nFor the third, we consider the effect of the upstream process on the output(s) of the downstream process. If the level of output is increased, or the rate of production of the output is increased, then the direction is increased. Direction can be positive, negative or neutral or capable of either direction. Two positives in succession yield a positive, two negatives in succession yield a positive, otherwise the default assumption is that the net effect is canceled and the influence is neutral.\n\nEach of these 3 primitives can be composed to yield a cross-product of different relation types." xsd:string

comment: This relation can be used to link an assertion directly to evidence items that support it. Evidence items are typically organized into 'evidence lines' that group them according to the argument(s) to which they contribute.  This shortcut  relation supports use cases where it is desirable to elide over this level of organization and create direct links from an assertion to the fundamental pieces of information that represent evidence supporting it.\n\nA property chain (has_evidence_line o has_evidence_item -> has_evidence_with_item) is defined that can be used to infer this direct edge, facilitating interoperability between data sets that do and don't implement evidence lines to organize evidence items.

comment: An agent that originated or gave existence to the work that is expressed by the digital resource.\n\nThe author of the content of a resource may be different from the creator of the resource representation (although they are often the same). See pav:createdBy for a discussion.\n\npav:authoredBy is more specific than its superproperty dct:creator - which might or might not be interpreted to also cover the creation of the representation of the artifact.\n\nThe author is usually not a software agent (which would be indicated with pav:createdWith, pav:createdBy or pav:importedBy), unless the software actually authored the content itself; for instance an artificial intelligence algorithm which authored a piece of music or a machine learning algorithm that authored a classification of a tumor sample.\n\nThe date of authoring can be expressed using pav:authoredOn - note however in the case of multiple authors that there is no relationship in PAV identifying which agent contributed when or what. If capturing such lineage is desired, it should be additionally expressed using PROV relationships like prov:qualifiedAttribution or prov:wasGeneratedBy.

comment: An agent primary responsible for making the digital artifact or resource representation. \nThis property is distinct from forming the content, which is indicated with pav:contributedBy or its subproperties; pav:authoredBy, which identifies who authored the knowledge expressed by this resource; and pav:curatedBy, which identifies who curated the knowledge into its current form. \npav:createdBy is more specific than its superproperty dct:creator - which might or might not be interpreted to cover this creator. \nFor instance, the author wrote 'this species has bigger wings than normal' in his log book. The curator, going through the log book and identifying important knowledge, formalizes this as 'locus perculus has wingspan > 0.5m'. The creator enters this knowledge as a digital resource in the knowledge system, thus creating the digital artifact (say as JSON, RDF, XML or HTML). \nA different example is a news article. pav:authoredBy indicates the journalist who wrote the article. pav:contributedBy can indicate the artist who added an illustration. pav:curatedBy can indicate the editor who made the article conform to the news paper's style. pav:createdBy can indicate who put the article on the web site.\nThe software tool used by the creator to make the digital resource (say Protege, Wordpress or OpenOffice) can be indicated with pav:createdWith.\n\nThe date the digital resource was created can be indicated with pav:createdOn.\n\nThe location the agent was at when creating the digital resource can be made using pav:createdAt.
