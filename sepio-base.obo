comment: ICEs are abstract entities that convey information about things in the world. ICEs represent the information encoded in physical artifacts such as photographs, books, or digital storage medium (as opposed to the physical medium itself).  A particular ICE can be encoded simultaneously in many physical or digital mediums and formats. For example, only one instance of the first edition of "War and Peace" exists as an ICE, representing information conveyed in this work. But many instances of "War and Peace" exist at the level of their physical concretizations in printed books or digital devices.

def: "An abstract entity representing the sharable meaning of what is expressed in a particular assertion." []
comment: The notion of a proposition, and its relationship to an assertion, derives from the domain of logic and philosophy [12]. Propositions are abstract entities that, like numbers, are independent of space and time. They represent only the meaning that is expressed in a particular agent’s assertion, and are ‘sharable’ in that the same proposition can be expressed in many different assertions. Propositions are primary bearers of truth value, in that they are true or false.  \n\nFrom http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/propositions/: "Propositions are the sharable objects of the attitudes and the primary bearers of truth and falsity. This stipulation rules out certain candidates for propositions, including thought- and utterance-tokens, which presumably are not sharable, and concrete events or facts, which presumably cannot be false."

As truth bearers they are either true or false. They are taken to represent the semantic content of sentences or larger lexical entities formulated in some natural or artificial language.\")\n\n2. http://purl.org/mp/Holotype\nThe notion of a holotype from the Micropublications model is related to a SPEIO proposition - in that it represents a statement that is selcted to all other statements expressing the same meaning.\n\n3. http://purl.org/oban/association\nAn OBAN proposition is a more type of proposition, that is structured/expressed according to the specifications laid out in the OBAN ontology." xsd:string

comment: Assertions as defined in SEPIO are the result of some logical inference made based on the interpretation of evidence.  They put forth a proposition that may or may not be true - the validity of which ultimately rests on the quantity, quality, diversity, and concordance of evidence supporting it.\n\nStatements directly reporting study results or observations are not considered assertions in this sense, as they merely report what was observed or recorded, but do not rely on a leap of logical inference (see 'study finding').

comment: An evidence line is created through the interpretation of one or more pieces of information that collectively support a meaningful argument for or against a proposition. To qualify as an Evidence Line, this argument must be independently significant as evidence - i.e. it must be capable of affecting the probability of accepting the target proposition as true. This does not mean, however, that it is independently sufficient to establish belief in the proposition, as additional evidence lines may be required to ultimately accept the proposition as true. \nFor example, in the ACMG framework  for variant interpretations establishes "absence in population databases" as a type of evidence line that can argue for the pathogenicty of a particular variant. But this argument alone is not considered sufficient to establish a variant's pathogencity, as the other types of evidence are additionally required to establish the truth of this Proposition (e.g. a line of evidence demonstrating the variant to have a deleterious effect on protein function, or showing it to segregate with disease features in a family tree).

def: "A data item that quantifies the degree of support an agent believes an evidence line to provide for a particular proposition." []
comment: The strength of a line of evidence typically depends on the *type* and *quality* of the study(ies) that generate its supporting evidence items.  \n\n1. Type of Study: In a particular domain of research, certain types of studies are commonly held to produce data that is more meaningful and reliable than others, as evidence for a particular type of assertion.  These more reliable studies tend to draw on experimental systems that more accurately replicate the natural phenomenon being studied, and experimental designs that reduce confounding variables and biases. For example, in vivo studies of gene function provide stronger evidence than in vitro systems that may not replicate all aspects of the biology of a living system, and randomized controlled clinical trials are held to be more reliable than retrospective or case control studies that are more susceptible to confounding factors.  \n\n2. Quality of Study: A given study can be performed to varying degrees of rigor and comprehensiveness,  irrespective of the type of study it represents. This is another important factor in assessing the overall strength of evidence it may produce.  Higher quality studies will have carefully defined controls, and be replicated numerous times to ensure reproducibility.  Other factors that are often used as secondary indicators of the quality of research data include the quality of the journal in which it is published, and the reputation of the lab or institution performing the study. \n\nIn SEPIO, the notion of evidence quality is captured in an attribute separate from the notion of evidence strength. And the notion of study type can be represented in the type assigned to a study instance, or the evidence code used to type an evidence line (which are often based on the type of study that produced the evidence data).  Evidence strength typically relies on assessment of one or both of these more fundamental attributes of evidence.

comment: A study finding is a statement that summarizes the immediate results of a particular experiment or study. It describes only what was directly observed, measured, or calculated, and optionally the experimental context of these observations.  It does not describe more general conclusions that may have been inferred from such results. As such, the scope of what a finding describes is limited to the direct participants in the study - i.e. it is about only the instances observed or measured in the study.  It makes no broader inference or conclusion about types or classes to which these instances belong. \n\nThis is not to say that the onserved findings are necessarily accurate or correct - only that they were indeed made in a particular study. For example, the finding that "Sequencing of DNA from patient X revealed an A->T mutation at position 2143 in gene Y" is a matter of fact - this was the outcome of the assay, even if the finding is an artifact of low sequencing coverage. Metadata about the finding (e.g. sequencing methods/reagents used, coverage or read depth) are recoded so users can judge for themselves whether the objectively reported finding accurtely reflects the biology it describes.
comment: SEPIO distinguishes two high-level subtypes of statements:\n1. Findings are statements that report the immediate, objective results of an experiment, observation, or study -  without bias or interpretation.  A finding statement results simply from an act of reporting or summarizing these direct observations, calculations, or measurements.\n2. Assertions, by contrast, result from acts of interpretation and/or inference, based on information used as evidence. The statement here is a conclusion drawn from critical evaluation of this more foundational information, and its validity depends on the quality of this information and its interpretation as evidence.

Assertions, by contrast, are statements that derive from some degree of interpretation or inference based on the evaluation of 'evidence', and often make broader claims about the types or categories to which study participants belong. This distinction is important because the provenance and validity of a 'finding' statement does not depend on subjective interpretation of 'evidence' in the same way that of an assertion does. This has modeling implications for how findings and assertions are linked to information that supports them.\n\nIn practices, instances of 'study findings' are used to group one or more data items from a particular research study that are relevant as evidence for an assertion.  The utility of this class is in allowing the shared provenance of these data items to be more efficiently represented - as things like agent, date, and methods can be described once for the data set and inferred to apply to all individual data items that comprise it." xsd:string

So perhaps in SEPIO we commit to only considering research processes at the level of studies - such that even assays would potentially involve some act of summarizing the results as a finding.\n\n- Note that at present 'study data sets' can serve the same 'organizational' purpose as 'study findings' - we should converge on one recommended way to perform this level of organization of evidence data." xsd:string

def: "An information content entity expressing a declarative sentence that is either true or false." []
comment: From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statement_(logic) (2017-06-21):\n"A statement is a declarative sentence that bears truth value, in that it can be either true or false. This definition derives from the domain of logic, where a statement is either (a) a meaningful declarative sentence that is either true or false, or (b) that which a true or false declarative sentence asserts. In the latter case, a statement is distinct from a sentence in that a sentence is only one formulation of a statement, whereas there may be many other formulations expressing the same statement . . . In (this treatment), "statement" is introduced in order to distinguish a sentence from its informational content. A statement is regarded as the information content of an information-bearing sentence. Thus, a sentence is related to the statement it bears like a numeral to the number it refers to. Statements are abstract logical entities, while sentences are grammatical entities."\n----\nNote that the definition in (b) describes something closer to the notion of a 'Proposition' as defined in SEPIO?
comment: Statements are sentences (or, more precisely, the information content of sentences) that declare a definitive or proposed fact - expressing something about the world or one's experience of it that may or may not be true. The identity of a particular Statement is dependent upon (1) what it reports as true (its semantic content), (2) the Agent stating it, and (3) the occasion on which the statement is made. \n\nThe phrase "the pink elephant" describes an entity, but is not a 'statement' as it has no truth value. By contrast, the phrase "the pink elephant is in the room" is a statement as this can be evaluated for its truth.

def: "A statement describing something that was observed or recorded." []
comment: An observation reflects only what an agent observed or device recorded. It is therefore considered a matter of fact, rather than a propositional assertion that may or may not be true.  This does not mean that the observations or recordings were necessarily accurate or correct - only that they were indeed made by an agent.  For example, the observation that "I counted six ducks in the pond" is a matter of fact, even if there are actually seven because I missed one that was hiding in the reeds.

property_value: IAO:0000116 "In SEPIO, a high-level distinction is made between Statements that are  'Observations' vs 'Assertions'. Observations are statements that report what is observed, and are inherently true in the sense that they reflect an agents particular experience. Assertions are statements that derive from some degree of interpretation or inference based on the evaluation of 'evidence'. \n\nThis distinction is important because the ultimate truth of observations or findings do not depend on evidence in the same way that the truth of assertions does.  Accordingly, any data related to an observation is not treated as evidence, and captured as observations." xsd:string

id: http://purl.org/pav/authoredBy
name: Authored by
comment: An agent that originated or gave existence to the work that is expressed by the digital resource.\n\nThe author of the content of a resource may be different from the creator of the resource representation (although they are often the same). See pav:createdBy for a discussion.\n\npav:authoredBy is more specific than its superproperty dct:creator - which might or might not be interpreted to also cover the creation of the representation of the artifact.\n\nThe author is usually not a software agent (which would be indicated with pav:createdWith, pav:createdBy or pav:importedBy), unless the software actually authored the content itself; for instance an artificial intelligence algorithm which authored a piece of music or a machine learning algorithm that authored a classification of a tumor sample.\n\nThe date of authoring can be expressed using pav:authoredOn - note however in the case of multiple authors that there is no relationship in PAV identifying which agent contributed when or what. If capturing such lineage is desired, it should be additionally expressed using PROV relationships like prov:qualifiedAttribution or prov:wasGeneratedBy.

id: http://purl.org/pav/createdBy
name: Created by
comment: An agent primary responsible for making the digital artifact or resource representation. \nThis property is distinct from forming the content, which is indicated with pav:contributedBy or its subproperties; pav:authoredBy, which identifies who authored the knowledge expressed by this resource; and pav:curatedBy, which identifies who curated the knowledge into its current form. \npav:createdBy is more specific than its superproperty dct:creator - which might or might not be interpreted to cover this creator. \nFor instance, the author wrote 'this species has bigger wings than normal' in his log book. The curator, going through the log book and identifying important knowledge, formalizes this as 'locus perculus has wingspan > 0.5m'. The creator enters this knowledge as a digital resource in the knowledge system, thus creating the digital artifact (say as JSON, RDF, XML or HTML). \nA different example is a news article. pav:authoredBy indicates the journalist who wrote the article. pav:contributedBy can indicate the artist who added an illustration. pav:curatedBy can indicate the editor who made the article conform to the news paper's style. pav:createdBy can indicate who put the article on the web site.\nThe software tool used by the creator to make the digital resource (say Protege, Wordpress or OpenOffice) can be indicated with pav:createdWith.\n\nThe date the digital resource was created can be indicated with pav:createdOn.\n\nThe location the agent was at when creating the digital resource can be made using pav:createdAt.

comment: Derived from a different resource.\n\nDerivation conserns itself with derived knowledge. If this resource has the same content as the other resource, but has simply been transcribed to fit a different model (like XML -> RDF or SQL -> CVS), use pav:importedFrom. If a resource was simply retrieved, use pav:retrievedFrom. If the content has however been further refined or modified, pav:derivedFrom should be used.\n\nDetails about who performed the derivation (e.g. who did the refining or modifications) may be indicated with pav:contributedBy and its subproperties.

def: "The original source of imported information.\n\nImport means that the content has been preserved, but transcribed somehow, for instance to fit a different representation model by converting formats. Examples of import are when the original was JSON and the current resource is RDF, or where the original was an document scan, and this resource is the plain text found through OCR.\n\nThe imported resource does not have to be complete, but should be consistent with the knowledge conveyed by the original resource.\n\nIf additional knowledge has been contributed, pav:derivedFrom would be more appropriate.\n\nIf the resource has been copied verbatim from the original representation (e.g. downloaded), use pav:retrievedFrom.\n\nTo indicate which agent(s) performed the import, use pav:importedBy. Use pav:importedOn to indicate when it happened." []

comment: The URI where a resource has been retrieved from.\n\nThe retrieving agent is usually a software entity, which has done the retrieval from the original source without performing any transcription.\n\nRetrieval indicates that this resource has the same representation as the original resource. If the resource has been somewhat transformed, use pav:importedFrom instead.\n\nThe time of the retrieval should be indicated using pav:retrievedOn. The agent may be indicated with pav:retrievedBy.

comment: Source accessed at
comment: The resource is related to a given source which was accessed or consulted (but not retrieved, imported or derived from). This access can be detailed with pav:sourceAccessedBy and pav:sourceAccessedOn.\n\nFor instance, a curator (pav:curatedBy) might have consulted figures in a published paper to confirm that a dataset was correctly pav:importedFrom the paper's supplementary CSV file.\n\nAnother example: I can access the page for tomorrow weather in Boston (http://www.weather.com/weather/tomorrow/Boston+MA+02143)  and I can blog ‘tomorrow is going to be nice’. The source does not make any claims about the nice weather, that is my interpretation; therefore the blog post has pav:sourceAccessedAt the weather page.
